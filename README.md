## Things To Consider When Doing a Wearable Data Collection Study
Wearables have been a rage these past few years and you might be thinking about doing a research study using them. There are very many wearables devices out there, so what are the considerations to be taken into account when choosing one? The points listed below will aid in your decision making. So where do you go to get the needed information on these points? You can get these information by reading the specs of the devices, reading their support forms, reading reviews, and calling customer support.
# Commercial versus Research-grade Device
The major differentiating factors between these are cost and the quality of data. Commercial devices tend to be cheaper than research-grade devices. However, the data collected using research-grade devices tend to be of a higher quality.
# Sensors on the device
What sensors are on the device? If you are interested in different types of data, you want a device that has all or most of those sensors so you don't burden your users with multiple devices.
# Data Collection Intervals
In what intervals is the data collected? If you are for example interested in heartrate data, does the device collect that data every second or every couple of seconds or a couple of times every minute?
# Automatic versus manual activity detection
Does the device automatically and correctly identify what activity the user is engaged in at any given moment (walking/running/biking/driving)? You want a device that automatically detects activities without the user having to manually prompt it into a particular activity mode. Does the device also offer a way for the user to edit misidentified activities? 
# Age of users
Some devices are specifically designed to be used by children while others are designed to be used by adults. Using a device for a non-recommended age group might lead to inconsistent or inaccurate data.
# Battery life
How long does the battery last in different use cases? Under normal usage, you want a device whose battery life lasts at least a day so users don't have to think about charging it in the middle of the day. You also want a device whose battery charges up quickly and is not cumbersome to connect to the charging kit.
# Device ecosystem
Most wearable devices come with a companion app that can be installed on a mobile device or computer and a website. Users can view the collected data on the device (if it has a display), the mobile app, the desktop app, or the website.
# Data Syncing
How do you get the data off the device? Most devices sync to a companion app on a phone through Bluetooth. Others sync to a desktop app using the USB port. From here, the data is normally uploaded to a cloud server. Very few devices can directly upload the collected data from the device to the cloud directly. You want a device with minimal user interaction to get the data off of it.
# Device Data Storage 
This is something that most users of commercial wearable devices do not think about because it doesn't come up as often. Wearable devices have limited storage, but because the data is synced to the companion app consistently (if connected to the companion app using Bluetooth or when charging using USB), most users don't notice this. So what happens if the Bluetooth is not switched on for a long time? Or if the device runs out of battery and is not charged? What happens varies from device to device. Some devices overwrite old data whenever any new data is collected. Others are programmed to automatically overwrite old data after a given time period regardless of whether there is new data or not. Your study protocol therefore has to account for this so you don't end up with no data at the end of the study period.
