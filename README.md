## Considerations When Doing a Wearable Data Collection Study
Wearables have become very popular these past few years and you might be thinking about doing a study using them. There are very many wearables devices out there, so what are the considerations to be taken into account when choosing one? The points listed below are not an exhaustive list of what to consider, but they are helpful in arriving on a decision on what device to go with. Most of this information can be gleaned by reading the specifications of the devices, visiting their online support forms, reading reviews about them, and speaking with the customer support to find out more about the device.
### Previous Use Cases
When thinking about a wearable device, one of the first steps is to find out if it has been used before in another research study and what challenges were encountered during that study. If there are no previous cases, having a conversation with the manufaturer about the possibility of using their device for such a use-case is important.
### Commercial versus Research-grade Device
The major differentiating factors between these are cost and the quality of data. Commercial devices tend to be cheaper than research-grade devices. However, the data collected using research-grade devices tend to be of a higher quality.
### Sensors on the device
What sensors are on the device? If you are interested in different types of data, you want a device that has all or most of those sensors so you don't burden your users with multiple devices.
### Data Collection Intervals
In what intervals is the data collected? If you are for example interested in heartrate data, does the device collect that data every second or every couple of seconds or a couple of times every minute?
### Automatic versus manual activity detection
Does the device automatically and correctly identify what activity the user is engaged in at any given moment (walking/running/biking/driving)? You want a device that automatically detects activities without the user having to manually prompt it into a particular activity mode. Does the device also offer a way for the user to edit misidentified activities? 
### Age of users
Some devices are specifically designed to be used by children while others are designed to be used by adults. Using a device for a non-recommended age group might lead to inconsistent or inaccurate data.
### Battery life
How long does the battery last in different use cases? Under normal usage, you want a device whose battery life lasts at least a day so users don't have to think about charging it in the middle of the day. You also want a device whose battery charges up quickly and is not cumbersome to connect to the charging kit.
### Device ecosystem
Most wearable devices come with a companion app that can be installed on a mobile device or computer and a website. Users can view the collected data on the device (if it has a display), the mobile app, the desktop app, or the website.
### Data Syncing
How do you get the data off the device? Most devices sync to a companion app on a phone through Bluetooth. Others sync to a desktop app using the USB port. From here, the data is normally uploaded to a cloud server. Very few devices can directly upload the collected data from the device to the cloud directly. You want a device with minimal user interaction to get the data off of it.
### Device Data Storage 
This is something that most users of commercial wearable devices do not think about because it doesn't come up as often. Wearable devices have limited storage, but because the data is synced to the companion app consistently (if connected to the companion app using Bluetooth or when charging using USB), most users don't notice this. So what happens if the Bluetooth is not switched on for a long time? Or if the device runs out of battery and is not charged? What happens varies from device to device. Some devices overwrite old data whenever any new data is collected. Others are programmed to automatically overwrite old data after a given time period regardless of whether there is new data or not. Your study protocol therefore has to account for this so you don't end up with no data at the end of the study period.
### Companion App
If the study is being done in an environment without consistent internet access, it is important to test out if the collected data can stay on the companion app for the whole duration of the study. Also test whether the data stays on the device if the user is signed out of the account in the companion app.
### Data Access
Each wearable has their own way of presenting the collected data to the user. The most common way to access the data is through the companion mobile or web application. For a research study though, access through such apps is not adequate so you need a wearable that allows the data to be downloaded onto a file. This is mostly provided through an API or a generic downloadble file.
### Raw versus Derived Data
Most commercial wearables show their users derived data and not the raw data, for example, number of hours slept and the amount of time in each stage of sleep and not show the raw data that was used to arrive at that number. Additionally, the algorithms used to generate the derived data are not publicly available. This might be an issue if the raw/derived data is deemed untrustworthy.
### Data Storage Duration
How long does the wearable company store the data on their cloud servers? Some companies delete the data after a certain period of time, so it is important to download and store this data safely on your own system.
### Data Display Screen
Some wearables have a display screen that shows the recorded activity data while others do not have such screen. If you do not want the study participants to react to the collected data, it is advisable to go with a wearable that does not have a data display screen.
### Device Usability/Look
People are conscious of what they wear, so if the wearable is clunky and very visible, users might not be as willing to put them on throughtout the day. Most of the research-grade wearables tend to not look as good as the commercial ones, so users might end up not wearing them when they are in public.
### Data Ownership
Who owns the data that is collected using the wearable? Does it belong to the user or the company that makes the wearable? Can a user successfully request the company to delete all the data the wearable has collected?
### Privacy
How secure is the collected data in the wearable company's servers? Do your due diligence by finding out their security measures and if those measures meet the standards required for the study. Besides the data collected by the sensors on the wearable device, what other data is collected by the wearable company? This is especially the case when there is a companion mobile app. Be sure to check what types of permissions are requested by the companion app and if those permissions are really necessary. If user anonymity is important, ensure to disable those permissions that might leak identifiable information.
### Health Issues
Some of the wearables have been known to have issues such as causing skin rashes or causing skin burns whenever the battery heats up. DO your due diligence to find out whether the device you intend to use has experienced such issues in the past.
### Wearable Manufacturer
The wearables industry changes very quickly, so it is important to choose a wearable from a reputable company that is not likely to go out of business soon. This is especially important if the study is going to run for a long period of time. Another important point is to choose a company that a good support. A lot of wearables malfunction after awhile, so it is really helpful if the manufacturer has a good support team that can help fix such problems.
### Software Updates
Firmware updates to the device and software updates to the companion app might affect the collected data, so download the already collected data before making any updates. For example, a firmware update might erase the unsynced data residing on the device. The best way to go about this is to have extra devices that are used for test purposes. If a new update breaks your protocol, then don't install such an update on the real study devices, or amend your protocol in accordance with the new version of the app/wearable.
### Ease of usability
Users are more likely to respond positively to a device that is easy to use. The onboarding process for the users should therefore be very straight forward. This is especially the case with a study where you mail the devices to the users and then they set up the wearable on their own. 
### Managing Groups of Users
Commercial wearables are intended for individual daily use and therefore do not offer features to manage a large number of devices. Devices meant for research on the other hand offer features to manage a large number of devices involved in a study. 
### Incentives
Users are more receptive to having a wearable in the beginning of a study. However, as the awe of the device fades, they might find it hard to wear it every day. So it is important to have an incentive for them to keep putting on the device.
